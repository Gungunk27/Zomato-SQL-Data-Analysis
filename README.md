# Zomato_SQL_Project
This repository contains a SQL-based data analysis project focused on Zomatoâ€™s dataset. The project involves creating and managing tables such as customers, orders, deliveries, riders, and restaurants to perform analysis and generate insights using PostgreSQL.

## Tables Created

### customers: Details about customers who have placed orders.
### orders: Information on customer orders, including items, order status, and total amount.
### deliveries: Delivery status and delivery times linked to the orders.
### riders: Information about delivery riders and their signup dates.
### restaurants: Information on restaurants including their city, name, and opening hours.

Using the created tables, we performed various data analysis tasks.
